        Can AI Ever Become Capable of Original Thought?
      </h2>

      <p class="par1">
        While artificial intelligence has many positive attributes, originality
        isn’t one of them. But do we really want AI tools that can think for
        themselves?
      </p>

          There’s concern that an AI technology capable of original thought

      <p class="all-par">
        AI is making impressive strides in many areas, including speech
        recognition and generation, natural language processing, image and video
        creation, planning, and decision-making. Yet one function it has yet to
        successfully acquire is generating purely original thoughts.
      </p>

      <p class="all-par">
        At its core, AI operates on algorithms and data, says Greg Kostello, CTO
        at Huma.AI, a healthcare AI company, via an email interview. “The
        concept of original thinking in humans is deeply intertwined with
        consciousness, emotions, experiences, and intuition,” he observes. While
        AI can generate novel outputs and solutions by combining existing
        knowledge in unique ways, it doesn’t “think” in the same way humans do.
        “It’s more accurate to say that AI can exhibit ‘emergent behaviors,’ or
        produce results that weren’t explicitly programmed,” Kostello explains.
        “However, whether this qualifies as original thinking is a matter of
        philosophical debate.”
      </p>

      <p class="all-par">
        Current AI systems, including advanced machine learning models, are
        primarily based on pattern recognition and statistical inference from
        large datasets, says Udo Sglavo, vice president of advanced analytics at
        AI and analytics firm SAS, via an email interview. “This is why they
        excel at tasks like language translation, image recognition, and
        generating text based on training data,” he says. “However, these AI
        systems do not possess consciousness, self-awareness, or the ability to
        engage in truly original thinking.”

      <p class="all-par">
        The possibility of machines acquiring a form of consciousness or true
        original thinking is debated among experts in the AI and neuroscience
        fields, observes Shomron Jacob, head of applied machine learning and
        platform at generative AI firm Iterate.ai, via an email interview. “If
        it were to happen, it would require breakthroughs beyond current
        understanding, integrating insights from brain science, cognitive
        science, and computer science,” he says. “Predicting a timeframe is
        speculative at best, but many experts believe we are several decades
        away, if not longer, from even the potential of such a development.”
      </p>

      <h2 class="head">Originality Counts</h2>
      <p class="all-par">
        Original thinking could be defined as the ability to generate novel
        solutions or ideas without being explicitly trained on them. “In that
        case, some AI models are already exhibiting this [capability] to a
        degree, especially in the realm of generative models,” Kostello says.
        “However, for AI to achieve a form of thinking that mirrors human
        originality and creativity, would require breakthroughs in understanding
        human consciousness and cognition and then translating that
        understanding into computational models.” Predicting a timeline for such
        advancements is speculative, he notes, “but significant progress could
        likely be made in the next few decades.”

      <p class="all-par">
        Consider the creation of art. An artist might paint a landscape inspired
        by a childhood memory, an emotion, or a dream, Kostello says. “In
        contrast, using generative models, AI might create a piece of art by
        analyzing thousands of existing artworks, extracting styles, patterns,
        and themes, and then generating a novel composition.” So, if a human
        collaborates with AI to generate a piece of art outside of the artist’s
        original conception or vision, should that be called an original
        thought?
      </p>

      <h2 class="head">A Cause for Concern?</h2>
      <p class="all-par">
        There’s concern that an AI technology capable of original thought could
        shake humanity to its core. “Philosophically, it would challenge our
        understanding of consciousness, intelligence, and the uniqueness of
        human thought,” Jacob says. Meanwhile, industries could be
        revolutionized or made obsolete. Human interactions, dependencies, and
        relationships with machines could undergo a profound shift. Ethically,
        it would raise concerns about the rights of such entities and our
        responsibilities towards them, he notes.
      </p>

      <p class="all-par">
        Jacob points out the fact that highly regarded thinkers, such as Stephen
        Hawking and Elon Musk, have already expressed serious concerns about
        uncontrolled AI development. “The risks involve the potential for
        superintelligent AI to operate outside human control, and the ethical
        implications of creating entities that might have their own desires or
        sufferings,” he explains. “It’s crucial to ensure that research in AI is
        paired with robust ethical considerations, safety protocols, and
        regulatory measures.”
      </p>

      <p class="all-par">
        It’s important to constrain technology in ways that allow building only
        trustworthy systems, Sglavo says. “At the current pace of technological
        advances, it will eventually become difficult for laypeople to discern
        between an AI system and a human,” he predicts. “That means it will
        become increasingly difficult to identify original thought.” Sglavo
        believes that regulations will be necessary to prevent AI from
        misleading unsuspecting humans.
      </p>

      <h2 class="head">Final Insights</h2>
      <p class="all-par">
        Technology should serve humans, not vice versa, Sglavo says. He notes
        that the pace of AI development will be a key factor in determining
        whether people should worry about the technology evolving to the point
        of original thought. “Other critical factors include developing a
        reliable regulatory framework and how society addresses the ethical and
        safety concerns involved with AI,” Sglavo adds. “Human interactions are
        sufficiently complicated already. I don’t believe we’re ready to add
        another independent party to the discussion.”
